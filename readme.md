# Load Testing with NBomber
Load testing is a crucial aspect of software development and system maintenance. 
It involves subjecting a software application, website, or system to simulated 
user loads and analyzing its performance under such conditions. The primary goal 
of load testing is to determine how well the system can handle the anticipated 
workload and identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. By generating heavy 
user traffic, load testing helps assess factors such as response times, resource 
utilization, stability, and scalability. It enables developers and administrators 
to proactively address any weaknesses and optimize the system for optimal performance 
and user experience. Ultimately, load testing plays a vital role in ensuring that 
applications and systems can handle the demands and expectations of real-world 
usage scenarios.

## What is NBomber?
>NBomber is a modern and flexible load-testing framework for Pull and Push scenarios, 
designed to test any system regardless of a protocol (HTTP/WebSockets/AMQP, etc) or a 
semantic model (Pull/Push).

>NBomber is free for personal use, developer-centric, and extensible. Using NBomber, 
you can test the reliability and performance of your systems and catch performance 
regressions and problems earlier. NBomber will help you to build resilient and performant 
applications that scale.
